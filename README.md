### Predicting Poker Hands in Texas Hold'em using Probability

## BASIC PLAN
1. Input cards on table
2. Calculate probabilities of highest hands
3. Update probabilities every time a card is played
5. Use computer vision to recognise cards
6. Webpage to view highest possible hands

## IDEAS 
* Java
* Python w/ OpenCV for card recognition
* Use Golang/NodeJS to pull the whole thing together into a web-based application

## FUTURE DEV
* Use ML to create poker AI (reference only. Cannot play the game, only offer advice based on calculations)
* Run poker AI against human players and see what decisions it would make (i.e. check, raise, call, all-in, fold)
